# Employee-Engagement-Analysis
Excel based analysis of HR survey data to support workforce engagement decisions.
## Problem Statement

The Seattle Department of Public Works recently conducted an internal survey to assess job satisfaction and employee engagement across its 21 departments. Despite collecting over 14,500 individual responses from approximately 1,500 staff members, the HR team lacked a clear, actionable understanding of the results. Raw survey data was inconsistent, unstructured, and difficult to interpret.

As a newly hired Human Capital Analyst, my task to transform this complex dataset into a clean, visual, and insight-driven analysis. The goal was to uncover key drivers of employee satisfaction, identify areas of concern, and support data-informed recommendations to improve morale, motivation, and retention across the workforce.

## üìä Objectives

1. **Explore & profile the data** to identify and fix data quality issues.
2. **Prepare and reformat** the survey results for visual analysis.
3. **Visualise the responses** and provide actionable HR recommendations.
